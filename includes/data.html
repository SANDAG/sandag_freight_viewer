        <p><i>SANDAG Freight Viewer </i> Viewer was created primarily as a platform for a freight asset inventory and a framework for visualizing for freight data. This framework is intended to improve the access to freight facility data throughout the region in order to improve planning, economic development, and public awareness around freight in the San Diego Region.</p>
        <p>Our data sets have been developed through data development activities, public outreach, as well as research and planning studies in the region. Additionally, regional private sector and public partners have contributed valuable data related to the appropriate nomenclature of facilities and have provided in-house data to further refine the accuracy of the <i>SANDAG Freight Viewer</i>.</p>
        <p>Below you will find details about each of our data layers and links to download the current data available in <i>SANDAG Freight Viewer</i>.</p><br/>

                        <p>The SANDAG Freight Highways data layer was based on SANDAG's Major Roads dataset representing major highways and arterials in the region. The dataset uses generalized centerlines of highway segments and ramps to depict each of the major freight serving highways as identified by SANDAG staff. The highways are limited to regional serving routes including interstates and limited-access highways. This dataset is mapped by route name number and is merged to display the route and route mileage only at this time. More detailed roadway inventory will be added in the future.</p>

                        <p>National Highway System (NHS) connectors are roads, which may be either state or locally owned, which connect intermodal facilities to major highways on the National Highway System. The NHS Connectors in this data layer are officially designated NHS freight connectors that serve any of three types of facilities: intermodal rail facility, port, and/or airport. These routes were digitized based on DVRPC's street centerline data set to correspond with the officially designated NHS Connector routes.</p>

                        <p>TThe SANDAG freight rail data layer is a subset of SANDAG’s master railroad network dataset. This master dataset was developed to identify key ownership, operation and track type details for passenger and freight rail lines in the San Diego region, extending into adjacent counties and northern Baja California, Mexico. This data set was developed internally using various rail project mapping, track charts and aerial imagery. </p>
